# CombinarHorarios
A project I made for creating schedules with all possible outcomes, depending on your activities timetables.

It was made to be used with the website the Argentinian university ITBA provides. It is a Microsoft Windows working version.

I made this project when I had little knowledge of C and programming in general so the code is pretty nasty. Nonetheless, the code works, there are no known bugs and it has over 1300 views at my sister's website: https://sites.google.com/site/apuntesmartu/combinar-horarios
